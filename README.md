# hyperterm-safepaste

**IMPORTANT** I will no longer support this repository as I am not using Hyper terminal anymore.
If you need any change or fix, please fork the repository and make the changes you need.

I have moved to [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal which has a lot of features that I need and it is very fast.

Makes pasting into [Hyperâ„¢](https://hyper.is/) Terminal safe

## Demo

## Features

- When pasting a single line, trims extra newlines from the end. This makes sure your command will not be executed automatically until you press enter.
- When pasting multiple lines, a popup will give you a chance to review and edit the text before sending it into the terminal. Escape cancels the paste.
